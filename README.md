# Network-class-
I've created a simulation to a Social Network Program where the user can add friends, remove friends and other features. Written in Python and is solely console based.

I worked a lot with Test Driven Development for this program using doctest and unitest which are attached below.

I have also created a new networkmodule  where I use a dictionary instead of elif statements, it's a much faster and more efficient algorithm. I am attaching the file below as well.
